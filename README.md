Included features:

Create object in blender and export them in archicad
generate optimised 3D shape
Emmbed texture in object file (no missing textures, and no bad references when editing libraries and migrating projects)
Level of detail (to be reworked to be simpler to handle and more efficient)
seamless surface replacement in archicad


Planned features:

Handle different types of objects (lights, door handles, door panels, windows, etc...   In summary, everything gdl.)
Handle parametric shapes
Create self-shadows for plan visualisation (would look like the ambiant occlusion pass from rendering, but with little computational cost and all vectorial elements)
Generate optimised 2D symbol automaticaly
account for metadata (price, reference...)
Mac support
Version updater (update objects created with precedent version of addon)


Half Known bugs
bad reference when mirror modifier has merge vertices enabled
images/materials/objects names incorrectly handled when containing certains characters
